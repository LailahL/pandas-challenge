Assignment 4 Analysis:
Based on the data gathered, I could conclude that middle and small sized schools have students getting high grades.  Most probably this is because of the student:teacher ratio.  The lesser the number of students, the more their teachers are able to focus in making sure students understand their lessons.
Higher Spending per student doesn't mean high grades.  The results show students who were spent less on tend to get good grades.  Probably it would be safe to assume that students who get good grades needs less resources.  Students with low grades needs more hours from teachers, higher pay to teachers means higher spending. 
Lastly, District Schools students get lower grades in Math & Reading.  There is no conclusive reason why this is so compared to Chartered Schools.  This might be due to 
some other factors, like the kind of environment the students are in.
